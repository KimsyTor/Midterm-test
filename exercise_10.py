Instructions:
-------------

Your task is to create a Pig Latin translator. 

In Pig Latin, there are many rules, but for this exercise we will only use 2:


1) If a word has a vowel (A, E, I, O, U) at the beginning, add way to the end.

Example: ant -> antway


2) If a word has a consonant (any letter that is not a vowel) at the beginning, 
   move the first letter to the end add ay to the end.

Example: cat -> atcay

text = "hello world"

def translate_pig_latin(text):
    
    vowels = "aeiouAEIOU"
    
    # Your code goes here
    pass

def main():
    # Your UI code goes here (add user input and show how to use the function with the example list)
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
