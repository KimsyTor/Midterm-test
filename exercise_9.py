Instructions:
-------------

Your task is to create a function to count words in a list that rhyme together.

Use the function count_rhyme to find the number of words in the list that rhyme.

The function should return the number of words in the list that rhyme with the given word.

For example:

rhyme_list = ['shell', 'llama', 'smell', 'tell']
word = 'dell'

In this example, the output should be 3 because in the list 3 words rhyme with "dell."

rhyme_list = ['cat', 'rock', 'mat', 'paper', 'chat', 'car']

word = 'bat'

def count_rhyme(rhyme_list, word):
    # Your code goes here
    pass

def main():
    # Your UI code goes here (add user input and show how to use the function with the example list)
    pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
