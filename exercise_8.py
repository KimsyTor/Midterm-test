Instructions:
-------------

You have been given a list of numbers. 

Your task is to return the missing numbers.

Example: 

my_list = [5, 7, 9]

find_missing_number(my_list) -> Output: 6 8

In this example, the output is 6 and 8 because when counting up from 5, 
only 6 and 8 are missing. (list = 5, 7, 9 --> should be = 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)

gap_list = [2, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8, 10, 11, 13, 14, 15]

def find_missing_number(gap_list):
    # Your code goes here
    pass

def main():
    # Your UI code goes here (add user input and show how to use the function with the example list)
    pass
